4,,Theyâ€™re a keeper!,Love these diapers and have used them almost exclusively since 2019 for my two daughters (18 month old used her entire life and my 3.5 year old). I chose them because of the low cost and also they claim to contain fewer chemicals than Huggies/Pampers. They have worked great for us. Minimal leakage but we do use huggies overnight for the younger child. No skin reactions. Like the plain white and polka dot pattern. Fit babies well and they seem comfortable. For toddlers they sag when wet but we still use because of the low cost. I also think...,
3,,Love this diaper!,Much better than other brands like pamper and huggies! Itâ€™s light and has perfect fit!,
2,,Decent diaper for the price,"The price is fine, but the absorbency leaves much to be desired for overnight wear. Is fine for during the day as long as you don't have to go a long time without a change (long car ride etc).",
4,,"Great, stretchy diaper","These are very good quality diapers at a good price point. We used Huggies because they were good quality but inexpensive compared to Pampers. However, I would have purchased these Amazon brand diapers since they are equally as good expensive as Huggies yet of a slightly better quality. When I say better quality I mean the Amazon brand diapers absorbs a childâ€™s bodily fluids well but also stretches better than Huggies at the waist. The result is a stretchy diaper that provides better comfort to the child.",
4,,Very good diapers,This was the 1st time I ordered these diapers I seeing the good reviews and always switching up diapers to see which one works better and I am very happy with these diapers they hold up very well and they're very good shape no leakage very happy the price I just ordered another big pack,
2,,Wetness leaks through more than other brands,We went back to our other brand because the diaper would feel damp and it would make the clothes damp also.,
4,,Great diapers,"Love this brand! My son, whose skin is very sensitive to certain materials and fragrances, has had no problem.",
3,,Good purchase,Purchase with confidence this is a good product ðŸ‘Œ,
1,,Donâ€™t like the crystals,"Youâ€™ll quickly see why these are so affordable. The absorbent gel expands massively, and it feels like the gel beads inside one of those cheap spa eye gel coolers. Seeing as PFAs and other chemicals are largely responsible for the decline in fertility, I donâ€™t want that near my sonâ€™s bits. I knew there would be a sacrifice at this price but not worth it.",
