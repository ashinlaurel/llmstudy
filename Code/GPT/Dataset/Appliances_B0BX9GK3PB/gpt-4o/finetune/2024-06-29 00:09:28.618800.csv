4,1437136,4.0,Very Good - But dinged up like a lot of other review,"Great little freezer but, like many other reviews, was dinged up slightly in a few spots.  Don't care how it looks as it is down in the basement, just how it works.  And it works great.  But the company does need to do a much better job at packaging and handling obviously with the inordinate number of reviews of dinged up freezers out there.",

4,1652592,5.0,Educating Some Reviewers,"For the reviewer who suggested that ""date code 200709"" was 2007... No.  The format is YYMMDD, so the product that you reviewed in October of 2020 was manufactured July 9th of 2020, just four months prior to your purchase.<br \/><br \/>As for reviewer Lily who said, ""inside it's new, outside it's old"" with photos... remove the protective plastic film wrap, dear!  The whole purpose of that film wrap is to prevent scratches during transit.  Once your peel away all the wrap from the top and sides, the exterior will look polished and clean.",

4,1636046,,,"Purchased Feb. 2019 and died Sept. 2020. It was a great freezer and I like it’s compact size. Due to poor quality copper and bad assembly, a crack developed in a refrigerant line. One section of copper was bent like a straw which caused sharp creases. The high pressure finally decided to blow it apart. It can be repaired for about $50-75 in my area. It’s a great freezer but I wish it did not have this flaw and now needs repair.",3.0
